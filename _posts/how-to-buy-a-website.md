From the buyer’s perspective, this could be a great chance to finally start an online business without having to worry about the usual basics. Starting an online business takes a lot of time and effort, after all. You would have to think about a concept, then think of a catchy name for it. You have to register a domain and hire an entire team to set the website up.

When you buy an existing online business, you get to tick off a lot of these from the list. You even get whatever existing audience that the business has. And once you have full control of that domain or website, you can always add your own flavor to it and tweak it any way you want to. Whatever you believe would make that business sell, you can do.
